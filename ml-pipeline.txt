1. Frame the problem clearly
2. Create success metrics
3. Create systematic tracking for prompt engineering
4. Correct model selection and evaluation
5. RAG, 
    - chunking 
        a. break up docs into chunks (depends on use case)
        b. measure retrieval accuracy (speed for correct retrieval)
        c. 
    - embedding
        a. how the layers are going to be set up
        b. finding the right storage software
    - retrieval
        a. create a search algo that can retreive the embeddings
        b. find ways to optimize (re-ranking searches)
    - evaluate your RAG
        a. retrieval accuracy (recall@ok)
        b. end-to-end accuracy
6. Agent systems
    - Kimi model (use for Claude Code)
    - context engineering
    - task decomposition
        a. find the tool/agent group to use
        b. assign roles to specific agents
        c. ensure reporting output for each agent
7. System monitoring and error analysis
8. Deployment and UI
9. Fine-Tune
